# Hospital-Emergency-Room
Designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze hospital emergency room performance, including patient volume, wait times, admission rates, and referral trends. The dashboard provides real-time insights into patient demographics, satisfaction scores, and department efficiency to support data-driven decision-making.
Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

Project Overview

This project presents a dynamic Power BI dashboard designed to analyze hospital emergency room performance. It provides real-time insights into patient volume, wait times, admission rates, referrals, and satisfaction scores. The dashboard enhances decision-making by offering an in-depth view of patient demographics, treatment efficiency, and hospital workflow.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard focuses on the following primary KPIs:
Number of Patients: Tracks the total count of patients visiting the emergency room.
Average Wait Time: Measures the efficiency of patient intake and treatment processes
Patient Satisfaction Score: Evaluates service quality based on patient feedback.
Number of Patients Referred: Analyzes the frequency of patient referrals to other departments or hospitals.

Features

Filter Panel: Enables users to filter data by month, patient demographics, and department referrals.
Patient Admission Status: Differentiates between admitted and non-admitted patients.
Age and Gender Distribution: Visualizes patient demographics for better resource allocation.
Response Time Analysis: Assesses the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes.
Daily and Hourly Patient Trends: Identifies peak emergency room hours and days.
Department Referrals: Tracks patient movement across different hospital departments.
Insights & Conclusions
Consistent patient influx, with peak times identified for improved staff allocation.
Average wait times provide room for process optimization to enhance efficiency.
Higher patient satisfaction is linked to faster response times and streamlined admissions.
Referral trends highlight opportunities for better inter-department coordination.
> Note: This dashboard was developed as an educational project for healthcare analytics and operational efficiency improvement.
